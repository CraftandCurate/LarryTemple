        <h4>The Dance of Our Time</h4>
        <pre>
They move as one, in perfect stride,
Their worries left, nowhere to hide.
They twirl and spin in synchronized grace,
A fleeting moment, time can't replace.

Laughter echoes beneath starlit skies,
With every glance, a sweet surprise.
No future, no past, just rhythm and rhyme,
Two souls bound in the dance of our time.

        <h4>Moonlight Messenger</h4>
        <pre>
The moon spilled secrets onto the floor,
A silver scroll through an open door.
Its beams crept quiet across the bed,
Like whispers where no words were said.

And in that hush, a memory stirred,
Not quite a dream, not quite a word.
It warmed the air, then slipped away—
A moonlight messenger by break of day.
