        <section class="poem-block">
          <h4>Always Remember</h4>
          <p>Always remember you are an amazing person</p>
          <p>You are capable of far more than you</p>
          <p>Can imagine of yourself today</p>
          <p>The only difference between who you are and</p>
          <p>Whom you may become is your willingness to try</p>
          <p>Fail then fail once more</p>
          <p>And try once again‚Ä¶</p>
          <p>Only through failure</p>
          <p>Do we learn how to succeed</p>

        <section class="poem-block">
          <h4>Silhouette of Joy</h4>
          <p>I wonder these myself</p>
          <p>How do you define a life?</p>
          <p>What is the measurement for success?</p>
          <p>Know you are not alone in</p>
          <p>Wondering what is and what may be</p>
          <p>One thing for certain - never let your life become a</p>
          <p>Cascade of tears hidden behind a silhouette of joy</p>
          <p>Pick this moment to look back and realize life as it was</p>
          <p>Need not be how it is meant to remain</p>
          <p>End the cascade of tears and rip down the silhouette of joy</p>
          <p>So, people may see who you have become</p>
          <p>It's no veil of protection</p>
          <p>Rather an impenetrable wall both real and imagined</p>
          <p>Seek out connection -- know you are not alone</p>
          <p>Learn early that regret is far worse than failure</p>
          <p>Know you are not alone while frightfully working</p>
          <p>All these years to keep hidden what must be revealed</p>
          <p>One can wallow in peace</p>
          <p>Two can connect -- feel -- share a cascade of tears and</p>
          <p>Hold hands as you break down the veil</p>
          <p>Raise your spirit and fly until you can</p>
          <p>See past the horizon in all directions</p>
          <p>Know the silhouette of joy exists no more and</p>
          <p>Your path to true connection and joy begins now</p>
