          <p>The clock is ticking — every attack is less than 24 hours away. FBI agent Noah Reardon is at the center of the most devastating series of attacks in U.S. history. Singled out and taunted, Reardon and his team attempt to thwart the next strike. Each day brings new destruction, mounting pressure, and haunting memories of his time in Afghanistan. With the President’s response fraught with uncertainty, Reardon must track terrorists hiding in plain sight — ghosts among millions. Join him in this journey of terror, redemption, and psychological warfare.</p>
